## PyGame (Game Development Library) 🐍️

From Basic to Advance level gaming tutorial.
In this repository you can find my learning from day 1 to day end by prefix `day`.

### Introduction: 📔️

- Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules which is used to create video games.
- It consists of computer graphics 🤖️ and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.
- Pygame was officially written by **Pete Shinners** to replace PySDL.
- Pygame is suitable to create client-side applications that can be potentially wrapped in a standalone executable.

### Installation: 🎉️
Recommended to create a virtual enviorment and install the library.

`pip3 install -U pygame --user `

### Check Installation 💫️

To check whether the pygame is properly installed or not, in the IDLE interpreter, type the following command and press Enter:

`import pygame`

Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html

### ENOUGH OF THESE BULLSHIT 🛑️ LET'S JUMP TO CODE SEE WHAT WE CAN DO 🤩️

#### Day 1 📅️

- `screen_disaply.py` - To give an idea about basic syntax.
- `display_image.py` - Adding a image on white blank surface.
- `pygame_rect.py` - *Rect* `rect()` is used to draw a rectangle in PyGame.

#### Day 2 📅

- `keypress_event.py` - Pygame KEYDOWN and KEYUP detect the event if a key is physically pressed and released.
- `draw_using_key_event.py` - We see KEY Press, now let's draw something using keyboard.
- `geometry_shape_draw.py` - Let's draw rectangle, polygon, ellipse, straight line, circle, elliptical arc using pygame.

#### Day 3 📅

- `text_and_font.py` - Let's render the font and text and also size and color the font.
- `sprite_collision_detection.py` - A pygame sprite is a two-dimensional image that is part of the large graphical scene. Usually, a sprite will be some object in the scene.
- `multimedia_library.py` - `pyglet()` another game library which is cross-platform for windowing and multi-media. It supports user interface event handling, windowing, OpenGL graphics, loading images and videos, and playing sounds and music.
